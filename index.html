Moreover, to be a mentor for younger models, understand cultures, fashion, design and photography, learn how to deal with anyone from anywhere and study languages. I speak English, Ukrainian, Russian and Spanish.</p>
        <p>I’ve graduated “with honors” with a bachelor in business management and master in management of external activities. While studying I was a part of a non-profit organization Enactus ONU. I learned how to work as a team-member and find solutions for different problems.</p>
        <p>During pandemic of 2020, I discovered the world of tech. Programming became my passion.
