        <div class="about">
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">My name is Vladyslava and I am a full stack developer. Motivated, driven to expand my knowledge and become an irreplaceable asset to your company.</p>
        <p>I had been a professional athlete for 16 years: figure skater and sprint runner. Winning hundreds of awards has taught me discipline, determination, also hard work.</p>
        <p>Years of work as an international fashion model allowed me to see the world, live in 9 different countries, work with famous designers and magazines. Moreover, to be a mentor for younger models, understand cultures, fashion, design, and photography, learn how to deal with anyone from anywhere, and study languages. <i>I speak English, Ukrainian, Russian and Spanish.</i></p>
        <p>I’ve graduated “with honors” with a bachelor in management and a master in management of foreign economic activity. While studying, I was a part of the non-profit organization Enactus ONU. I learned how to work as a team member and find solutions for different problems.</p>
        <p>During the pandemic of 2020, I discovered the world of tech. Programming became my passion. I finished HarvardX cs50 Introduction to computer science along with cs50 Web-Programming with JavaScript and Python.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Therefore, please take a look at my work. Let’s see what we can achieve together.</p>
